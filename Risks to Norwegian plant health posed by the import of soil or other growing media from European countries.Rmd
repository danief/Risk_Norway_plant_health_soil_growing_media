### Chapter: Visualizing European Countries of Interest in R

#### Overview
This chapter explains how to visualize selected European countries using R. The script uses `rnaturalearth`, `ggplot2`, and `tidyverse` libraries for data manipulation and plotting.

#### Steps

1. **Import Libraries**: Import `rnaturalearth`, `rnaturalearthdata`, `ggplot2`, and `tidyverse`.

2. **Fetch Data**: Use `ne_countries` from `rnaturalearth` to get medium-scale world data.

3. **Define Area of Interest**: List European countries of interest, including Albania, Andorra, Austria, etc., up to Vatican City.

4. **Modify Data**: Add a new column "area" to indicate if a country is in the area of interest. Use `mutate` from `tidyverse`.

5. **Create Visualization**: Use `ggplot` and `geom_sf` to plot the data. Customize the plot with colors, themes, and labels to differentiate between the selected and other countries.

6. **Export Plot**: Save the plot as a PNG file with specified dimensions and resolution.

### Chapter: Processing EFSA SGM Species Data in R

#### Overview
This chapter outlines a script to process data from the EFSA SGM species using various R libraries like `readxl`, `tidyverse`, `reshape2`, and others.

#### Steps

1. **Import Libraries**: Libraries such as `readxl`, `tidyverse`, `reshape2`, `httr`, `XML`, `rlist`, and `jsonlite` are loaded for data manipulation, HTTP requests, and data transformation.

2. **EPPO API Key**: Read the EPPO API key from a file path.

3. **EPPO Code Retrieval Function**: Define `get_eppo_code` function to fetch the EPPO code for a given pest name using an API call.

4. **Process species Data**: 
    - Read species data from an Excel file.
    - Transform the data to a long format using `pivot_longer`.
    - Clean and rename columns, especially the species names, removing unnecessary characters and spaces.
    - Create a new column `new_value` to classify interaction based on certain criteria.

5. **Retrieve EPPO Codes**: Use `lapply` to apply `get_eppo_code` function to multiple species to fetch their EPPO codes.

6. **Combine Data**: Merge the pest names with their corresponding EPPO codes into a data frame. Replace any "****NOT FOUND****" entries with `NA`.

7. **Finalize Data**: Use `left_join` to bind all relationships and `distinct` to find unique records across all columns.

8. **Export Processed Data**: Save the cleaned and processed data as an Excel file in a specified directory.
